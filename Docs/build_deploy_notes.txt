Steps to deploy a release:

* Update the server version in both the server and client
1. Play test the game, at least one full game.
2. Run AIvAI for at least 100 games.
3. Do a build of the server: 

From the project Server/java directory (where pom.xml is):

> mvn clean install

To skip tests:

> mvn clean install -DskipTests

If everything goes ok, you'll see a lot of stuff scroll by ending with a BUILD SUCCESS message. This also runs the unit tests.

To execute to jar from Server/java

java -jar target/galacdecks.jar &

A bunch of log lines (you may see some errors related to Hibernate), followed by a netty ACTIVE message.

The server should now be running locally.

Play test the game against the build.

4. Build the client for the target platform(s)

5. For each client 




To test, load http://localhost:8080/ (or whatever port) in your browser. You should see a WebSockets test page.

Send the following JSON message to the server:

{command : "testgame"}

It should respond with some player tokens.

To deploy to ec2:

Connect to ec2 with FTP client
Upload galacdecks.jar to /home/ec2-user (or wherever)
Upload data directory

Connect to ec2 with Putty
Terminate existing galacdecks process, if any (ps -ax, sudo kill id#)

sudo java -Xms64m -Xmx768m -jar galacdecks.jar &
